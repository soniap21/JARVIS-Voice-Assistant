JARVIS - Voice Assistant 

It was an interesting task to make my own assistant. It became easier to send 
messages without typing any word, Searching on Google without opening the 
browser, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music, opening your 
favourite IDE with the help of a single voice command. 

Jarvis is different from other traditional voice assistants in terms that it is specific 
to desktop and user does not need to make account to use this, it does not require 
any internet connection while getting the instructions to perform any specific task. 
The IDE used in this project is PyCharm. All the python files were created in 
PyCharm and all the necessary packages were easily installable in this IDE. For this 
project following modules and libraries were used i.e. pyttsx3, SpeechRecognition, 
Datetime, Wikipedia, Smtplib, pywhatkit, pyjokes, pyPDF2, pyautogui, pyQt etc. I 
have created a live GUI for interacting with the JARVIS as it gives a design and 
interesting look while having the conversation. 

With the advancement JARVIS can perform any task with same effectiveness or 
can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that the concept 
of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. Functionalities of this 
project include, It can set alarms, It can read PDF, It can send text on WhatsApp, It 
can open command prompt, your favourite IDE, notepad etc., It can play music, It 
can do Wikipedia searches for you, It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., 
in a web browser, It can give weather forecast, It can give desktop reminders of your 
choice. It can have some basic conversation.

Voice recognition software enables hands free use of the applications, lets 
users to query or command the agent through voice interface. This helps users to 
have access to the agent while performing other tasks and thus enhances value of 
the system itself. JARVIS also have ubiquitous connectivity through Wi-Fi or LAN 
connection, enabling distributed applications that can leverage other APIs exposed 
on the web without a need to store them locally.
Virtual assistants must provide a wide variety of services. These include:

• Providing information such as weather, facts from e.g. Wikipedia etc.

• Set an alarm or make to-do lists and shopping lists.

• Remind you of birthdays and meetings.

• Play music for you from Youtube or other applications.

• Read daily news headlines.

• Sending messages on whatsapp.

• Doing mathematical calculations.

• Play videos on youtube and downloading youtube videos.

• Controlling the system like Shutdown, Restart, Volume Up/Down etc
